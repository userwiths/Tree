I started this project as an exercise.
But now I think about it more like a framework.

So if you want to add some-thing like an example
of how you used it, it would be welcome to the 'Example'
folder.

If you are refering to something within the main files, {Mind:Actions:States}
After looking in to youre suggestion (and hopefully without breaking anything)
it will be addet in to the file to which it fits best :).

If you reached to here, thanks for the attention.
